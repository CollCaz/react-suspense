# Formal Status

👨‍💼 Let's clean up things a little bit with what we've built so far by making the
status of our promise a little more formal.

What we have now is:

- if there's an error, throw it
- if there's no ship, throw the promise
- render the ship

But that's not exactly clear.

So instead, let's add a `status` variable that can be
`'pending' | 'resolved' | 'rejected'` (start it out with `'pending'`).
