# Responsive

Something you'll remember from previous exercises is that when you suspend with
a `useTransition`, React hangs on to the previous state and gives you a pending
boolean so you can display the pending state. The problem with this is if you
want to display the state that triggered the transition. For example, if the
user is typing in a search box which you're controlling with state, you want to
keep the `<input />`'s `value` up-to-date with what they're typing, not with
the previous state while React is waiting for the transition to complete.

So we need a way that allows us to both display some pending state while also
allowing us to display the state that triggered a component to suspend. This is
where `useDeferredValue` comes in:

```tsx
const deferredValue = useDeferredValue(value)
const isPending = deferredValue !== value
```

`useDeferredValue` makes React do something kind of funny. It makes React render
your component twice. Once with the `deferredValue` set to the previous `value`
and second with the `deferredValue` set to the current `value`. This allows
React to handle components that suspend and you can know whether to display
pending UI based on whether the `deferredValue` and `value` differ.

The React docs do a good job explaining how this works, so
[ðŸ“œ check the `useDeferredValue` docs](https://react.dev/reference/react/useDeferredValue)
for details.

This may feel pretty similar to `useTransition`. Both give you the ability to
handle pending UI for suspending components. `useDeferredValue` is what you'll
use more often for typical user interactions. `useTransition` will normally be
handled when the user is navigating or refreshing a whole UI.

It should be noted that this can also be used to keep things snappy if you have
a component that's particularly slow. You can pass the `deferredValue` to the
slow component and the rest of the application will be highly responsive to user
interaction. The slow component will only update when it manages to finish
rendering with the latest `deferredValue`. This works because the background
renders can be thrown away whenever the `deferredValue` changes.
