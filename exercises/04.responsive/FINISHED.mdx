# Responsive

👨‍💼 You now know how to use `useDeferredValue` to give us the benefits of a
responsive UI when there's a deferred value.

🦉 If you want to understand a little more about how `useDeferredValue` differs
from `useTransition`, then try to replace the `useTransition` in the previous
example with `useDeferredValue`. You'll notice we no longer get a "transition"
where we preserve the previous UI while the new UI is loading and instead we
go straight to fallbacks.

Different solutions for different use cases.
