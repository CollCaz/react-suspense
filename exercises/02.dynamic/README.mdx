# Dynamic Promises

## Promise caching

Fetching data in our components is great, but this would be a problem:

```tsx
async function fetchUser() {
	const response = await fetch('/api/user')
	const user = await response.json()
}

function NumberInfo() {
	const [count, setCount] = useState(0)
	const userInfo = use(fetchUser())
	const increment = () => setCount((c) => c + 1)
	return (
		<div>
			Hi {userInfo.name}! You have clicked {count} times.
			<button onClick={increment}>Increment again!</button>
		</div>
	)
}
```

The problem is every time you click the button, `fetchUser` will be called again
triggering a new fetch request for the user which is not only inefficient, but
it would trigger the `NumberInfo` component to suspend which would render the
suspense boundary and result in a pretty janky experience even if your user
endpoint was fast and the user had a fast network. This is not a good user
experience.

The solution to this is to add caching to our `fetchUser` function. That way, if
the `fetchUser` function is called again, we can return the same promise that
was returned previously:

```tsx
let userPromise
function fetchUser() {
	userPromise = userPromise ?? fetchUserImpl()
	return userPromise
}

// "impl" is short for "implementation"
async function fetchUserImpl() {
	const response = await fetch('/api/user')
	const user = await response.json()
	return user
}
```

By returning the same promise, React will keep track of that specific promise
and it knows whether it's already resolved and needs to suspend or not.

Of course, this is a simple example. Caching like this normally involves a lot
more thought. For example, what if we could fetch a user by their ID? We
couldn't just have a `userPromise` anymore, we'd now have to have a mapping from
the user's ID to the promise that fetches that user:

```tsx lines=1,3,4
const userPromiseCache = new Map<string, Promise<User>>()
function fetchUser(id: string) {
	const userPromise = userPromiseCache.get(id) ?? fetchUserImpl(id)
	userPromiseCache.set(id, userPromise)
	return userPromise
}

async function fetchUserImpl(id) {
	const response = await fetch(`/api/user/${id}`)
	const user = await response.json()
	return user
}
```

This does get more complicated when you start thinking about the fact that the
user data could change and now you have to worry about cache invalidation. But
the point is that you need to cache your promises to avoid unnecessary
re-fetching.

## Transitions

Whenever you trigger a state update that results in a suspending component, the
closest suspense boundary will be found and its `fallback` prop will be rendered
until the promise resolves. This can be a jarring experience for the user if the
suspense boundary is far away from the component that triggered the state update
or the loading state is very different from the resolved state.

To make the transition from loading to resolved state smoother, you can use the
`useTransition` hook. This hook returns a tuple of two values: a boolean and a
function. The boolean is `true` when the promise is still pending and `false`
when the promise has resolved. The function is a callback that you can use to
trigger the state update that will result in the promise being fetched.

```tsx lines=3,7-9,13
function SomeComponent() {
	const [someState, setSomeState] = useState(null)
	const [isPending, startTransition] = useTransition()
	const someResolvedValue = use(fetchSomeData(someState))

	function handleChange(someValue) {
		startTransition(() => {
			setSomeState(someValue)
		})
	}
	return (
		<div>
			{isPending ? <LoadingSpinner /> : <div>{someResolvedValue}</div>}
			<button onClick={() => handleChange('some value')}>Change state</button>
		</div>
	)
}
```

The `isPending` variable there will be `true` while the suspending component is
waiting for the promise to resolve and `false` when the promise has resolved and
the component is ready to be rendered. This allows you to show a loading state
on the existing UI rather than using the suspense boundary fallback UI. It often
results in a much smoother user experience.
