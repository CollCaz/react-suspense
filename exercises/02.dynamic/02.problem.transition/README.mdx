# useTransition

👨‍💼 Whenever we change the ship, our component suspends. But this is annoying to
our users who are on reasonably fast internet connections because it means they
see a loading spinner every time they change the ship when it really would be a
better experience to have a more subtle pending state when the ship changes.

Our designer just told us to use a `0.6` `opacity` setting while the ship is
changing (for now). We can use the `useTransition` hook to accomplish this.

So wrap the state update in a transition and add opacity to the details so we
can give our users a better experience!
